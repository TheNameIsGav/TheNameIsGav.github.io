Reagents form the core of crafting. Reagents can be obtained from three primary sources - plant life (flora), mineral based sources (mineral), and as resources from animals (fauna). Reagents come in 5 tiers, common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary. Reagents may also contain affinities, which dictate the magical power they are infused with. Unique reagents also exist, although these are obtained by killing specific creatures (such the heart of The Grand Basilisk Morthag The Petrifier [coming soon]). These unique reagents count as a 6th tier. The important part of a reagents is different depending on the type of crafting being done (See individual crafting documents for further specification). The tier associated with each reagent is used to specify things such as its power level, its cost when purchasing from a vendor, and its rarity. The tiers of a reagent are as follows. 

| | Tier 1| Tier 2| Tier 3| Tier 4 | Tier 5 | Tier 6| 
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
|Complexity Rating Per Component |1|3|6|9|16|32|
|Cost Per Component (in gold) |25|50|200|400|800|1600|

### Obtaining Reagents
Reagents can be obtained via 3 methods. 
1. This is the simplest method, purchasing reagents from vendors. The availability of reagents can be determined by the general wealth of the city at the DM's bequest, however the average price of reagents depends on the tier of reagents as list above. 
2. By spending time to forage a reagent from the environment a player may, at any reasonable point okayed by the DM, roll a d20 plus Survival or Nature (players choice)\*.  Depending on the roll, they gain reagents based on the Reagent Table. They may attempt this roll up to their prof. number of times per day. Players may gain advantage on this roll if another player using a different skill (if player A chooses survival, player B must NOT choose survival to assist them), and the other player rolls above a DC 15 total. Reagents gathered in this way are considered "Flora"
3. By spending time to go mining, a player can obtain mineral reagents. "Mines" are considered any area where exposed rock can be found. Player can spend an hour at the mines, and make a number of rolls equal to their proficiency modifier. They roll a d20 plus Athletics or Constitution Save (players choice)\*. Depending on the roll, they gain reagents based on the Reagent Table. Players may gain advantage on this roll if another player using a different skill (if player A chooses Athletics, player B must NOT choose Athletics to assist them), and the other player rolls above a DC 15 total. Reagents gathered in this way are considered "Mineral". \*\*
4. The final method is by obtaining reagents by harvesting them from fauna. Reagents cannot effectively be harvested from medium humanoids (goblins, elves, humans, half-orcs, etc. for ethical reasons). For any other creature (at DM's discretion), a roll may be made by a single player to attempt to harvest reagents from that creature. A d20 plus Medicine or Sleight of Hand (players choice) is rolled\*. Depending on the roll, they gain reagents from the Harvesting Table. They may attempt this roll up to their prof. number of times per day, although the number of attempts on a single creature is limited. Players may gain advantage on this roll if another player using a different skill (if player A chooses Medicine, player B must NOT choose medicine to assist them), and the other player rolls above a DC 15 total. Reagents gathered in this way are considered "Fauna". 

For more details on reagent gathering and the mechanics of the Reagent Table, see the Reagent Table. 

\*An alternative skill may be chosen if a good reasoning is provided to the DM at the time of harvesting or foraging. 
\*\* The term "mine" and "mining" are to be used very loosely. Ore can be extracted from rocks found on the surface. Additionally however, players must have a pickaxe or other object capable of breaking rock to mine. 

### Reagent Table
When rolling against the Reagent Table, two rolls are required. 1, the roll on a d20 + the skill modifier that the player is using for their preferred reagent. 2, the roll on a d100 to verify the chance of gaining a reagent of particular rarity. 

The roll on the d20 determines the Distribution that the player is placed in temporarily. These distributions range from 1-5, with the higher distribution having larger ranges for the higher tier reagents. Listed below are the dice rolls on a d20 + the skill modifier that the different distributions fall into. As a note, natural 20's increase your distribution by 1, but do not guarantee the maximum distribution.

**Distribution Table**

| Distribution | Total Roll | 
| - | - |
| 1 | 1-10 (including natural ones) | (10 values)
| 2 | 11-19 | (9 values)
| 3 | 20-25 | (6 values)
| 4 | 26-29 | (4 values)
| 5 | 30+ | (1 values)

The roll on the d100 determines which reagent is actually found. Your roll fill fall into the range of one of the tiers listed below, and from there you gather the appropriate quantity of that reagent. You may also choose to gather reagents of a lower quality. If you do so, you gather twice the regular amount. 

| Reagent Tier | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4| Dist. 5| Base Reward Amount For Success | 
| - | - |  - | - | - | - | - |
| Tier 1 |61-100|76-100|81-100|91-100|91-100| 1 | 
| Tier 2 |31-60|36-75|56-80|66-90|75-90| .75 | 
| Tier 3 |11-30|16-35|16-55|41-65|56-75| .5 | 
| Tier 4 |6-10|6-15|6-15|11-40|21-55| .25 | 
| Tier 5 |1-5|1-5|1-5|1-10|1-20| .25 | 

Tier 6 reagents are given to players upon any harvest of a "boss" creature or as rare loot. This happens at the DM's discretion. 

Finally, all reagents have a 10% chance to have an affinity. What affinity that is is randomly selected from the schools of magic. The DM may choose to overrule the dice, and grant an affinity at their discretion. 


Below is an example of how a player might go about collecting reagents. 
```
Robert the Ranger decides that he wants to spend some part of his day collecting reagents. Being a ranger, he decides that his best bet is to harvest reagents from the surrounding forest. The DM decides that there is enough time, and requests Robert to make his rolls. Using his Survival skill, Robert forages 3 times, rolling a 1, 8, and 17. Roberts Survival skill is a 3, so his totals are 4, 11, and 20. This gives him distribution 1, 2, 3. Robert then uses GavBot's "/harvest" 3 times and enters in the totals 4, 11, and 20. He finds out that he got 1 Tier 1 Reagent, .75 Tier 2 Reagents, and .5 Tier 3 Reagents. Robert then add's it to his parties Reagent Sheet.
