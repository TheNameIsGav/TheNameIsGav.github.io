Smithing is the process of forging items out of the material components in the world. Smithing primarily uses the Source of the Reagent (Flora, Fauna, Mineral), as well as the tier in order to determine the power and specifications of an item. The reagents source used will specifically determine which attributes are added to a weapon. In general, flora components will gain benefits from Dexterity, fauna components will give a mix of both, and mineral components will gain benefits from Strength. 

**When using a component, it grants different benefits depending on what category it's from. The attribute doesn't matter.** 

**Additionally, reminder that all charts are cumulative. A Tier 3 reagent will grant the benefits from a Tier 1-3**


# <span style="color:red">Melee Weapons </span>
Melee weapons are forged using a Blade, a Guard, and a Grip. These components can be made from different reagents, but a complete weapon must have all 3 present in order to be used properly. Each component has a different effect when made out of a different material, which lets crafters customize the benefits they are receiving from a weapon that they craft. Weapon Skills are obtained from the **Guard** pathway on the various types of weapons. Those skills are listed below the component tables. 

```
E.x. Robert the Ranger chooses to craft himself a new scimitar. He makes the Blade out of a Tier 1 Flora, the Guard out of Tier 2 Fauna, and the Grip out of Tier 1 Mineral. His weapon would then have +1 to Crit Range, +1 Skill, and +1 Damage.  
``` 

### <span style="color:#FF7400">Flora Component Chart </span>
Blades: Increase Crit Range
Guard: Grants Skills.
Grip: Increases + to hit. 

<span style="color:green"> Designers note: if someone plays a Champion Fighter they have a 45% chance of critting per roll [69% with advantage]. Over three rolls thats.... alot of critting probably.) </span>

|Component | Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3|Tier 4|Tier 5|Tier 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Blade| +1 Range | + 1 Range | | +1 Range | +1 Range| +1 Range|
|Guard| | +1 Skill | | +1 Skill | | +2 Skills |
|Grip| +1 To Hit| | +1 To Hit| | +1 To Hit| +2 To Hit|

### <span style="color:#FF7400"> Fauna Component Chart </span>
Blades: Increase flat damage
Guard: Grants Skills.
Grip: Grants specific skills that are enhanced by nearby allies. 

|Component | Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3|Tier 4|Tier 5|Tier 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Blade| +1 damage | +1 damage | +1 damage | +1d4 damage| +1d4 damage| +1d6 damage|
|Guard| | +1 Skill | | +1 Skill | | +2 Skills |
|Grip| Grants "Feint" | | Grants "Synchronicity" | | Grants "Phalanx" | Makes all previous skills "Enhanced"|

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Feint** </span>
*Prerequisite: Fauna Grip Tier 1*
On your last Attack during your turn, you may choose to instead Feint an attack at an enemy. Make an attack roll as normal. If you roll above a 15 (including bonuses), give the next ally to make a melee attack that enemy +1d4 to hit. If your attack roll would critically miss and you still get above a 15, this effect does not occur. 

**Enhanced Feint**
*Prerequisite: Fauna Grip Tier 6*
Instead of adding +1d4 to hit on an allies next attack, instead add +1d6 to any melee attack roll they make during their turn. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Synchronicity** </span>
*Prerequisite: Fauna Grip Tier 3*
At the start of your turn, choose whether to use this ability. If you use this ability, mark an enemy that you can make a Melee Attack against. Forego the rest of your turn. On any allies turn, if they make a Melee Attack against the creature you Marked (and you can still make the attack), make an Attack. If you hit, treat the base damage of the weapon as maxed. (If you would crit, add another weapon dice to the damage roll)

**Enhanced Synchronicity**
*Prerequisite: Fauna Grip Tier 6*
Allows all "Melee Attacks" in Synchronicity to be read as "Attacks", including Ranged and Spell Attacks. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Phalanx** </span>
*Prerequisite: Fauna Grip Tier 5*
When a creature attacks, count the number of allies adjacent to you that are ALSO in the threat range of the creature attacking you. Gain +1 AC per ally that fulfills those conditions. 

**Enhanced Phalanx**
*Prerequisite: Fauna Grip Tier 6*
Gain +2 AC per ally instead. 

### <span style="color:#FF7400"> Mineral Component Chart </span>
Blades: Increases critical damage
Guard: Grants Skills.
Grip: Grants bonus damage. <span style="color:green"> Designer Note: This might want to be changed.</span>

|Component | Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3|Tier 4|Tier 5|Tier 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Blade| +1d4| +1d6| +1d8| +1d10| +1d12| +1d20|
|Guard| | +1 Skill | | +1 Skill | | +2 Skill |
|Grip| +1 damage | +1 damage | +1 damage | +1d4 damage| +1d4 damage| +1d6 damage|

### <span style="color:#FF7400"> Weapon Skills </span>
<span style="color:#FFC100">**Parry** </span>
Moving your weapon swiftly you can attempt to parry an attack. Using your reaction, you can roll to hit the target. If you succeed, subtract your weapons base damage die from the attack. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Shred** </span>
*Prerequisite: Flora Component*
By sacrificing the stability of your stance, you can create a breach in an opponents armor. Before you attack, you may decide to use this ability. Once you do so, if you hit, the opponent loses 2 AC until the start of their next turn. Performing this movement leaves you vulnerable, and attacks against you have advantage until the start of your next turn. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Rapid Attacks** </span>
*Prerequisite: Flora Component*
You may attempt to make additional attacks on your turn. After you make normal attacks, you may expend your bonus action to strike multiple times. You may make a number of attacks equal to your Dex Mod. For each additional strike you decide to make, subtract 3 from your base to-hit with that weapon. (If I decide to make two additional strikes, subtract 6). 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Whirlwind Strikes** </span>
When you make an attack, you may reduce the damage by 10 (to a minimum of 1), and make an attack against every enemy within your threat range. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Guard** </span>
Before moving on your turn, you may reduce your movement speed to 0, and your number of attacks by 1 (If it was already 1, then no change). By doing so, increase your armor class by 4 until the start of your next turn. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Power Attack** </span>
*Prerequisite: Mineral Component*
On an attack, you may choose to gain 10 damage by reducing your to-hit bonus by 5. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Cleave** </span>
Upon downing an enemy, you gain an additional attack (Max of 1). You may only move 5 feet between attacks gained this way. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Great Cleave** </span>
*Prerequisite: Cleave*
Upon downing an enemy, you gain an additional attack. You may only move 5 feet between attacks gained this way. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Weapon Focus** </span>
Choose a weapon type. For those types of weapons, gains +1 to hit. 
Specific for some kind of weapon, +1  to hit. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Weapon Specialization** </span>
*Prerequisite: Weapon Focus*
For a weapon type that you have Focus in, gain +2 damage.

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Mounted Combat** </span>
Negate attacks if you beat their roll? Just don't mount right now you dingi

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Spring Attack** </span>
*Prerequisite - Flora Blade*
If you are not wearing Heavy or Medium Armor, you may spend an attack to move without provoking opportunity attacks. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Disarm** </span>
You may replace one of your attacks to attempt to disarm an opponent. Roll to hit as normal, but do not deal damage. Instead, the target drops their current weapon (if able). As a passive, Disarm also allows you to take opportunity attacks against enemies swapping or picking up weapons. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Quick Draw** </span>
Swap weapons and do something poggers? Or prevent something not poggers?

# <span style="color:red"> Ranged Weapons </span>
Ranged weapons are forged using Limbs, a String, and a Grip. These components can be made from different reagents, but a complete weapon must have all 3 present in order to be used properly. Each component has a different effect when made out of a different material, which lets crafters customize the benefits they are receiving from a weapon that they craft. Weapon Skills are obtained from the **String** pathway on the various types of weapons. Those skills are listed below the component tables. 

```
E.x. Robert the Ranger chooses to craft himself a new longbow. He makes the Limbs out of a Tier 1 Flora, the String out of a Tier 2 Fauna, and the Grip out of a Tier 1 Mineral. His resultant weapon would gain +1 Crit Range, +1 Skill, and +1 Mineral Thing
``` 

### <span style="color:#FF7400"> Flora Component Chart </span>
Limbs: Increased Crit Chance
String: Grants Skills. 
Grip: Increases + hit

|Component | Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3|Tier 4|Tier 5|Tier 6|

|Limbs| +1 Range | | +1 Range| | +1 Range| +1 Range|
|String| | +1 Skill | | +1 Skill | | +2 Skill |
|Grip| +1 To Hit | | +1 To Hit | | +1 To Hit | +2 To Hit|

### <span style="color:#FF7400"> Fauna Component Chart </span>

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Limbs| +1 damage | +1 damage | +1 damage | +1 damage | +1 damage | +2 damage|
|String| | +1 Skill | | +1 Skill | | +2 Skill |
|Grip| | | | | | |



### <span style="color:#FF7400"> Mineral Component Chart </span>
*Making any ranged weapon with a Mineral component means that you may only move up to half your movement speed if you want to take the Attack Action with that Bow*
Limbs: Increased Crit Damage
String: Grants Skills. 
Grip: Provides benefits to other components by sacrificing movement. 

|Component | Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3|Tier 4|Tier 5|Tier 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Limbs| +1d4| +1d6| +1d8| +1d10| +1d12| +1d20|

### <span style="color:#FF7400"> Weapon Skills </span>
<span style="color:#FFC100">**Far Shot** </span>
Increase Range by 50%. Thrown weapons are doubled. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Point Blank Shots** </span>
You can +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against opponents within 15 feet. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Weapon Focus** </span>
Specific for some kind of weapon, +1  to hit. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Weapon Specialization** </span>
Prereq - Weapon Focus on the same weapon. 
Specific for some kind of weapon, +2 damage. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Rapid Reload** </span>
Prereqs - Crossbow
Load quicker

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Mounted Archery** </span>

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Precise Shot** </span>
Gain a +2 to hit on shooting enemies engaged in combat with an enemy. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Improved Precise Shot** </span>
Ignore concealment bonuses and cover bonuses that are not Total Cover. Additionally When you shoot at a target that is being grappled or is grappling, you automatically it. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Rapid Shot** </span>
Choose to gain one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon when you make an Attack Action. Suffer a -2 on each attack you make that round. 

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Many Shot** </span>
Each time you make an Attack, you may choose to add an additional arrow per shot. Each arrow uses the same to hit, but rolls it's own damage. You suffer a -4 to it on the attack if you choose to do this. Damage resistances and reduction apply to each arrow. 

Additionally, for every 5 points of attack bonus you have above +6, you may choose to add another arrow (max of 4 total) to the attack. Each arrow added this way adds another -2 to attack roll.  

<br></br>

# <span style="color:red"> Jewelry (Rings, Amulets, Bracelets, etc) </span>

Jewelry is made from a single main component, and then up to 3 optional components. Each component has the same effect.

A piece of Jewelry's CR does not contribute to the CR of an enchantment placed upon it. Additionally, it reduces the CR of enchantments placed upon it. However, if any component is reagent tier 3 or higher, the piece of Jewelry requires attunement.

|Component| Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3 |Tier 4|Tier 5|Tier 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Core|1 reduction|1 reduction|1 reduction|1 reduction|1 reduction|2 reduction|
|Additional Components|1 reduction|1 reduction|1 reduction|1 reduction|1 reduction|2 reduction|

Jewelry interacts with the reagents used more precisely than other Smithed items. Specifically, any use of a Tier 3 reagent or higher means that the jewelry requires attunement. Additionally, the use of reagents with elemental affinities will reduce the CR reduction of enhancements placed upon that item of the same school by their base value again (A tier 3 Necromancy affinity reagent provides a 6 CR reduction to necromancy enchantments, and a 3 CR reduction to enchantments of another type). This bonus stacks with itself. A piece of jewelry cannot reduce the CR of an item below CR 20. 

<br></br>

# <span style="color:red"> Armor </span>
Armor is unique in that it must be made of a singular type of reagent. (Fauna, Flora, or Mineral). The reagents can be different tiers. You can have a max of 4 reagents used on a piece of armor. 

```
Flora: +2 Base AC, Uncapped Dex
Fauna: +4 Base AC, Dex Capped at 2
Mineral: +6 Base AC, Dis Adv. on Stealth 
```

The unique aspect of armor is that you can choose a number of perks to add to your armor equal to $$ {Perks} = \text{Cumulative Tier Number} / 4 $$ rounded down. For example, if I make armor using 3 tier 1 Reagents and 1 tier 2 reagents, my Cumulative Tier Number is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5. (Designer Note: This means the most that a piece of armor can have is 6 additional perks, if it is crafted using 4 Tier 6 Reagents)

Below are listed the perks that you can choose to craft on your armor

<span style="color:#FFC100">**Reinforced Plating** </span>
Adds +1 to your AC

# <span style="color:red"> Shields </span>
Currently Shields cannot be crafted. 

<br></br>

# <span style="color:red"> Magical Foci </span>

Magical Foci amplify the spells of a users cast. Using different materials, one can create devices that change how spells behave. Flora Magical Foci enhance the damage or healing of a spell, Fauna components enhance the spell attack property of a spell, and Mineral components enhance the spell save DC of spells cast with the item. Making a Magical Foci with a Tier of 3+ means that the Magical Foci requires Attunement. 

Magical Foci are made with 2 components. 

### Flora Component Chart
Amplifies the Damage or Healing of spells. 

|Component| Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3 |Tier 4|Tier 5|Tier 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Centerpiece|+1 d/h |+1 d/h |+1 d/h |+1 d/h |+1 d/h |+2 d/h |

The bonus obtained from the Flora component is multiplied by the Spell Slot expended when cast. For example, if I have a Magical Foci made from a Tier 3 component, that gives me a +3 bonus at base. If I cast a Fireball with a 3rd level spell slot, that bonus goes up to +9. 

### Fauna Component Chart

|Component| Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3 |Tier 4|Tier 5|Tier 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Centerpiece|+1 Spell Attack|+1 Spell Attack|+1 Spell Attack|+1 Spell Attack|+1 Spell Attack|+2 Spell Attack|

### Mineral Component Chart
Magical Foci made from Mineral Components require 4 components to be crafted. (I.E. 4 Tier 2 reagents are required to gain the benefits from a Tier 2 Magical Foci -> CR of 22)

|Component| Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3 |Tier 4|Tier 5|Tier 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Centerpiece||+1 Spell Save DC||+1 Spell Save DC||+1 Spell Save DC|

# <span style="color:red"> Guns </span>

Gun's currently cannot be crafted

<br></br>

# <span style="color:red"> Other </span>

Ammunition can be augmented with any type of reagent. The tier of reagent is directly equal to the amount of damage it will do in addition. (Tier 1 Reagent is +1 damage). This crafts 20 pieces of ammo.
