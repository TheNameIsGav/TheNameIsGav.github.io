Alchemy functions similarly to enchanting, with some slight differences. 
- Duration can only go to a maximum of 1 minute. 
- Uses is locked to 1. 
- Action Economy is unused, and instead follows typical Action economy rules. 





Alchemy is similar to enchanting, but single use and more powerful. It uses the same system of reagents, and selecting the aspects of the potion, but generally each tier is stronger than an enchantment would be. Alchemical concoctions are single use, releasing all of their power in a single go. Alchemical concoctions can also not obtain the same level as enchanting in some aspects.

Unlike Enchantment, Alchemical potions have 1 use.

An alchemical potion can use the following **Aspects**, Nature, Power, Duration and Targets/AOE.

|Aspect|Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3|Tier 4|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Duration|1 round|1 minute|1 hour|4 hours|
|Targets/AOE|Self/Touch|10 ft. radius sphere|15 ft. radius sphere|30 ft. radius sphere|
|Complexity Rating|1|2|4|8|

Nature functions identically to Enchanting, it determines the Nature of the spell which helps with thematics and provides some bonuses depending on the **Reagents** used.

Damage also functions identically to Enchanting, it being simply a question of “does this do damage”.

Power is the one Aspect of Alchemy that can use higher tier reagents. It will result in more powerful concoctions. This is the primary way in which potions are more powerful that Enchantments.
