"Small starts often have the potential for great results" - Unknown Author

A garden must be maintained by the player, accounting for pest control, weeding, planting new crops, etc. As such, a common sized garden found in a players house will demand an upkeep of
- 4 hours per week of manual labor during which you cannot be interrupted and cannot be resting (can be spread out over the days (i.e. 30 minutes per day roughly))
- 1 gold piece per week to account for new tools, fertilizer, etc...

As a reward for such diligence, each week the garden is capable of producing 3 Tier 1 reagents. Every other week that these reagents are left to grow, the reagent tier is increased by 1 up to a max of Tier 4. When harvested, the player is guaranteed 3 units of the reagent they harvest. Players may choose to make a luck roll of a d100. On getting a 10 or lower, the amount harvested is increased by 1.

Robert the Ranger decides to plant a garden next to his humble abode. In amidst his adventures, he spends 30 minutes a day for 8 weeks to let his plants grow. At the start of the 9th week, he harvests the reagents, gaining 3 units of Tier 4 reagents. He gets especially lucky (Player rolled a 4 on a d100), and gains an extra unit of Tier 4 reagent. Robert the Ranger then decides to sell his reagents for a profit of 1600 gold pieces.

Larger gardens produce more, but require more time, space and money for upkeep, as well as possess a risk of failure when growing.
