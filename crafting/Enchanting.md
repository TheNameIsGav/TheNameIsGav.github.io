# The Basics

Where Smithing can be seen as a specific set of instructions, Enchanting can be seen more as a methodology. 

Players will come up with a spell or effect that they wish to imbue onto a weapon, jewelry, armor, shield, trinket, etc. This spell or effect will function much like a traditional Dungeons and Dragons spell, with effect text, materials, time to cast, duration, range, etc. The Dungeon Master will then assign the spell or effect a Complexity Rating (based on factors listed below that function similarly to the previous effect). 

In order to then create the effect, the player simply has to reach that Complexity Rating using a variety of reagents they have. Affinities on reagents that match the affinity of the spell cost double the value of the reagent. The player must then spend the time in the game in order to craft the enchantment onto the item in question. Any tools used add to the value that is provided by the reagents. 

Below are listed guidelines for power scaling, as well as an example of a typical exchange to create a spell. 

```
Alam approaches his DM with an idea:

A spell that is bound to a ring that firstly casts the web spell, and then the firebolt spell to ignite it. The spell reads as follows:

Flaming Webs
2nd level evocation

Casting Time: 1 Action
Range: 30 feet
Target: A point within range
Components: V, S, M (A spider's silk sack)
Duration: 2 Rounds

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube for the next two rounds (based on the start of the characters turn), at which point they disintegrate. The webs are instantly ignited, burning for the duration and dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire. 

Any creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free (requiring an action). 

This spell is essentially web, but on fire. As such, the DM would consider other similar spells, consults the guidelines charts, and decides that the effect would have a Challenge Rating of 15.

Alam then must decide which of his reagents he would like to use to reach 15. He decides to use

1 Tier 2's without affinities - 3 CR
1 Tier 2 with Evocation Affinitiy - 6 CR
3 Tier 1's with no affinity - 3 CR. 
Tier 1 Enchanters Tools - 3 CR

Alam's character then spends 13 hours to create it.

# Guidelines

## Spell Level
If applicable, the quickest way for a DM to power scale an effect is to look at similar spells or base spells if the player effect is based off of one. 
- Cantrip: 0-10
- Level 1: 11-20
- Level 2: 21-30
- Level 3: 31-35
- Level 4: 36-40
- Level 5: 41-45
- Level 6: 46-50
- Level 7: 51-55
- Level 8: 56-60
- Level 9: 61-65
- More Powerful: Varies
